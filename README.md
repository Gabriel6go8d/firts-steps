This is a practice project.

Used Tecnologies: 
HTML5  CSS3  Javascript  React  Bootstarp


In this little project I learned the basics of React, the Layout and Components, how to use Components dinamicaly, useStates and React Hooks. Also it worked as practice for Bootstrap, making the page responsive while displaying good stylish components.
